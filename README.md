# The Borrow Checkers: A Code Reading Group

A group of people who love to read code, inspired by the talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann).

We are still in an early phase, but we already had our first meetings and are planning to continue on a regular basis. Our focus is on the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

We usually meet on Tuesday 20:00 CE(S)T in our Jitsi room and are currently reviewing the [uutils coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) project.

The group is made of beginners and experts alike, but everyone is more or less new to Rust, so now we focus on learning the language, understanding the code, and finding simple bugs.

If you would like to join, don't hesitate to reach out in the [discussions](https://github.com/TheBorrowCheckers/about/discussions) or at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sagi_schwarz).
