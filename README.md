# The Borrow Checkers: A Code Reading Group

A group of people who love to read code, inspired by the talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann). We are in a very early phase of coming together and thus the group is currently private, but might open up in the future. More information to come.
